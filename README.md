# 👋 Hey, I’m Varleen

💻 I build backend systems and AI integrations that actually work in the real world. I’ve worked with everything from conversational AI pipelines to network protocols, and I like making systems fast, reliable, and scalable. I work mainly with **C, C++, Python, TypeScript, React**, and backend stacks on **GCP, Firestore, and Node.js**.

## 🌱 Currently
- Building an **offline AI learning assistant** using SLLMs  
- Diving deeper into **networks, cybersecurity, and operating systems**  
- Sharpening my **DSA and system design** fundamentals  
- Experimenting with ways to make AI tools reliable even without cloud access  

## 🔧 What I’ve Built Recently
- A fully functional **LLM proxy server** that rewrites and routes traffic through an LLM-powered middleware  
- **AI backend services** at GoodPath with real production deployment  
- **Vector-based retrieval systems** and optimized request-handling pipelines  
- **Reliable UDP-based file transfer system** using sliding windows and selective ACKs  
- **Full-stack applications** with secure auth, SQL tuning, and responsive UIs  

## 👀 Interests
Systems Engineering, AI Systems, Networks, Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems, and anything where performance actually matters.

## 🤝 Collaboration
Open to backend engineering, systems work, or AI projects that help people build, learn, or work faster.

👋 Hey, I’m Varleen  

💻 I build things that make AI actually useful — from RAG chatbots to backend systems that connect large language models with real-world apps.  
I work mainly with **TypeScript, React, React Native, C++, and Python**, and deploy on **Firebase** and **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**.  

🌱 Currently:  
- Building an **LLM proxy server** for flexible model routing and API management  
- Experimenting with **AI integrations** to make everyday systems smarter and faster  
- Sharpening my **algorithmic problem-solving** and **system design** skills  

👀 Interests: Software Engineering, AI Systems,Networks, Cloud Computing, and Scalable Backend Development  

🤝 Open to collaborating on projects that use AI to improve how people work, build, or communicate

⚡ Fun fact: My aim in Call of Duty is still *almost* as sharp as my my coding skills. 🎮🔥
